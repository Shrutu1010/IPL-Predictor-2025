The IPL Winner Predictor is a data-driven project that uses machine learning to predict the winning team in an IPL match. It analyzes past match data, team performance, and key features to generate accurate predictions. This tool helps fans and analysts make informed match forecasts.

🏏**IPL Winner Predictor 2025 – Finalist Hackathon Project**

Welcome to our IPL Winner Predictor 2025 project – a data-driven machine learning solution that predicts the winning team of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches based on historical and current season data. This project was successfully selected for the final round of a national-level Hackathon, recognizing its innovation, technical implementation, and real-world applicability.
🚀 Problem Statement
Predicting the winner of an IPL match involves analyzing multiple complex factors like team performance, player statistics, venue, toss decisions, and season trends. Our aim was to build a model that can intelligently process this data and provide reliable predictions for IPL 2025 outcomes.

🧠 **Our Approach**

We followed a comprehensive data science pipeline:

📊 Data Collection & Preprocessing: Utilized IPL data from 2008–2024, including match outcomes, player stats, toss results, and venues.

🔍 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Visualized patterns and correlations like home advantage, toss impact, and team form.

🧠 Model Building: Trained multiple ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) and evaluated their performance using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

⚖️ Model Selection: Final model chosen based on consistent cross-validation performance.

📈 Prediction & Visualization: Developed an interactive UI to input match details and predict the winner along with probability scores.

🛠**Tech Stack**

Languages: Python, JavaScript

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Backend: Flask

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap

Version Control: Git & GitHub

🌟 **Key Features**

📅 Predict match winners based on real-time inputs

📊 Visual dashboard for insights and performance metrics

⚙️ Model comparison and tuning for maximum accuracy

🏆 Final model achieved high prediction accuracy (80%+)

🎯 Optimized to simulate IPL 2025 scenarios


🏁**Hackathon Achievement**

Our project stood out among hundreds of entries and was selected for the Final Round of the IPL Hackathon 2025. The judges appreciated our end-to-end implementation, strong EDA, explainable model predictions, and the user-friendly interface.
